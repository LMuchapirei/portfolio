        to create stuff that solve problems. I <span className="underline">satisfied</span> with the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}

          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB for web and Flutter, SwiftUI for mobile development
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to keep up

        <span className="font-medium">UX/UI Design skills</span> as a software
        developer to create solution that are user centered and address users pain points.</p>
